          Pneu Scan is an AI-powered tool designed to assist in{" "}
          <strong>pneumonia detection</strong> from chest X-rays. We built this
          platform to provide a <strong>quick, accessible, and reliable</strong>{" "}
          solution for early detection of pneumonia, helping doctors and
          patients make informed decisions faster.

        <h2>How We Built It</h2>
        <p className="about-description" style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>
          Our system uses <strong>deep learning models</strong> trained on
          medical X-ray datasets. The frontend is developed with{" "}
          <strong>React & Vite</strong>, while the backend runs on{" "}
          <strong>Flask/FastAPI</strong>, integrating AI inference for accurate
          predictions.
